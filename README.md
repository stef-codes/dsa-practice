# Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) Practice

This repository contains implementations of various data structures and algorithms in Python, created as part of learning and practice exercises.

## Contents

- **Binary Search Tree** (`binary_search_tree.py`) - Complete BST implementation with insert, lookup, remove, and traversal
- **Arrays** (`ds_arrays.py`) - Array data structure implementations
- **Hash Table** (`hash_table.py`) - Hash table implementation
- **Linked List** (`linked_list.py`) - Linked list data structure
- **Stack** (`stack.py`) - Stack implementation
- **Breadth-First Search** (`bfs.py`) - BFS algorithm implementation
- **Interview Questions** (`interview_question.py`) - Various coding interview problems
- **Exercises** (`exercise.py`, `exercise2.py`) - Practice problems and solutions

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository
2. Navigate to any specific file to see the implementation
3. Run the examples to see the data structures in action

## Example Usage

```python
# Binary Search Tree example
from binary_search_tree import BinarySearchTree

tree = BinarySearchTree()
tree.insert(9)
tree.insert(4)
tree.insert(20)
print(tree.lookup(4))  # Returns 4
```

## Learning Goals

- Understanding time and space complexity (Big O notation)
- Implementing fundamental data structures
- Practicing common algorithms
- Preparing for technical interviews
